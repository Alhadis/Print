Change Log
==========

This project honours [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


[Unpublished]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Breaking changes:**
* __`print()` output is no longer consistent with v1's output.__  
  Authors who use this module to generate [`diff(1)`][1]-able print-outs
  of objects should update scripts and unit-tests to use the new format.
* __Module format is now native ESM instead of CommonJS.__  
  The entry-point has been renamed `print.mjs` and Node v13.2.0 or newer
  is now required to use this module.
* __`print.out()` has been removed.__  
  This did very little of importance whilst making the library dependent
  on the [WHATWG Console API][2], which isn't guaranteed to be supported
  by every ECMAScript environment.
* __Options have been renamed and certain defaults changed.__  
  In addition, the `escapeChars` and `showArrayLength` options have been
  removed. Both are overly-specific and of questionable usefulness.

**Enhancements:**
* Added recognition of [`Arguments`][3] objects
* Added support for printing [`__proto__`][4] properties
* Boxed primitives now include their internal `[[PrimitiveValue]]`
* Byte-arrays now display their contents as hex dumps
* Decorator characters can be customised via the `chars` option
* Functions now display their source-code when printed
* Only well-known symbols are identified using `@@â€¦` notation
* Printed `Math` and `Number` globals now show values of named constants
* Support for property sorting, coloured output, and custom indentation
